This is an HTML project as part of The Odin Project program.
I have made several amendments to this project.
The first problem I encountered was the broken links between the recipe and index pages.
I fixed these by updating the a href links and understand the use of "../" and "./"
Another problem I faced was github showing the readme file instead of my index file.
To fix this, I moved the index file out of the recipes folder.
I also made formatting changes such as changing heading sizes and typo errors in the content of the pages.
